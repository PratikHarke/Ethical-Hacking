The Next concept was of the XSS Attacks and it's types 
There are two main types of XSS ATTACKS as listed below :
1] REFLECTED / TEMPORARY XSS : This is the type of XSS attack that does not store any code on the webserver or the database of targeted server.
2] STORED / PERSISTENT XSS : This is the type of XSS in which the malicious code that is inserted in the webserver is stored permenantly on the database of the targeted webserver.

Information about the hands-on performed in lab :
1]REFLECTED XSS

Step-1] The site to be tested against Reflected XSS consisted of an field to accept the name.
To check for any weak links , I inspected the source code of the webpage provided.
A thing that was noticed was that when any user entered the name in the provided field the name woule be saved in the source code.

Step-2] After finding out about this loophole in the system , I tried an command to check if I could redirect the user.
Using ,
      <script> alert(You are hacked)!!! </script>
inside the name field , I was able tom display an error message of the above type and the user was thus unable to login.

2]PERSISTENT XSS

Step-1] We were provided an webpage with the access credentials of an seller to access the products on the webpage.
First I logged in using the provided credentials.
Once we were logged in , we were shown some variety of products on listing.
I tried to use the approach used in the above Reflected XSS attack but it was unsuccessful.
On careful observation found out that in source code image was stored with src.

Step-2] This was the area that should be worked with.
I logged out of the website.
Next , tried some combinations of image tag to manipulate the webpage.

The commands were,
<img src='x' onerror=alert("Hacked")>
this did'nt work , so tried another one 
<img src='x' onerror=alert(1)>
the second approach worked.
As we used the second command in user id and password field and the webpage was loaded ,
it would throw the error as 1 for the number of pictures currently available on the webpage being seen.

Next learnt about the ATTACK VECTORS and FORCED BROWSING concepts :
The main focus was the types and methodology of BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS.
The types were -
1] Logical Brute Force Attack.
2] Dictionary-based Brute Force Attack.

Forced Browsing :
When an user is able to access the webpage or an website using an post-login URL without logging into it , then this phenomenon is called as Forced Browsing.

Consider an example where aan seller has logged into his online shopping account ,
then if the URL contains any information related to an seller , then by manipulating it we can also be able to see the dashboard of other users.
i.e. if URL contains  'seller1' in it then by changing it to 'seller2' we could probably access information of another seller.
