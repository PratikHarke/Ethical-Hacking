Today I learnt about Types of malware ,  how they can be created and the ways to mitigate them.

Types of Malware :
1] Viruses : Vectors which carry malicious code but require user interaction to implement the code.
2] Worms : Same as that of virus but are capable of spreading on their own.
3] Trojans : These are the type of malware which are sophisticated or useful-looking and they trick user into downloading them.
4] Ransomware : In ransomware , the hackers would encrypt the confidential data and ask for ransome from the user for the decryption key.
5] Spyware : Softwares that collect the information on host without usser permission.

Hands-on creating a bat virus :

--We can simply create a file using any text editor containing the following command :
  " shutdown -s "
This file should be saved using the ".bat" extension.

--If we follow the given steps ,
i.e enter run in search tab 
type " shell:startup " in the popup,
then if the file created in above instance using ".bat" extension is saved here , 
the machine will go into shutdown as soon as it boots up and hence the user will be unable to use the machine.

Hands-on creating a basic fork bomb :
A fork bomb is a piece of code when executed keeps on calling itself until the host machin runs out of space.

--The code for the fork bomb is -
" :begin
  start %0
  goto begin "

--This file should also be created wwith a ".bat" extension.

--Again , if this file is saved in the windows startup then the user would be uanble to boot up his machine.

Malware Detection :
Malware Analysis Techniques are used to detect malware , they are -
1] Static Analysis - Malware is examined without executing it.
2] Dynamic Analysis - Malware is executed in an controlled environment called sandbox to check the behaviour and characteristics of it.
3] Behavioural Analysis - Malware is analysed based on behaviour.
4] Signature-based Identification - Patterns are used to identify similar types of malwares.

Malware Analysis Tools :
1] IDA pro.
2] Wireshark.
3] Sandbox.
