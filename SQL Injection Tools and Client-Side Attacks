Today I learnt about the tools used for SQL Injections :-
1] SQLmap
2] Havij
3] SQLNinja

I had an hands-on session on the use of two important tools which are commmonly used for SQL injections :-
1] SQLmap
2] Havij

In the hands-on session of SQLmap , URL was used as a primary target based on which a large amount of database was recovered from a test site.
In the hands-on of Havij , which is an automated SQL Injection tool , the SQL injection attack was quiet easily carried out on an test site.

Next I learnt about the Client-side attacks , commonly consisting of :-
1] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
2] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
3] USB drop attacks

Also learnt about the aspects and advantages of Document Object Model (DOM).
